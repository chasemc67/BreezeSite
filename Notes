ToDo:

[+] Wire services buttons
[+] get html select in contact us wired properly
[+] Hook contact component up to server
[+] Set default value for select


[ ] Alert user to incorrect entry in contact form

[ ] Add message at top for "Message successfully sent" and "message not sent, one or more fields missing"

[ ] Create a nav component that loses nav items on window resize, or just do with css
[ ] Switch from ajax to xmlhttprequest (and take notes in quiver about what both examples look like), and remove jquery

[ ] Check email sending from server in prod
[ ] Sanitize email message of script tags

[ ] Check if we want services text to be left aligned or centered in each instance. Because its different now than it was.
